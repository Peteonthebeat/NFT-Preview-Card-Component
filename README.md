## My process

- Starting with the mobile version, I first lay down all or at least most of the HTML. Then I look at the designs and decide what CSS properties they call for. I figure out whatever I don't know how to do on the go by googling stuff out and digging into sites like 'W3School,' 'Stackoverflow,' and random happens blog posts it happens I stumble upon...

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I wouldn't say I learned anything new besides not fearing jpg. Besides that, I was happy to refresh my knowledge of flex by practicing the 'justify-content: space-between property. It turned out that the icon parts call for it. I also figured out how to not use the <s> tag...

### Continued development

I plan to continue my coding journey by mastering flex and grid.

### Useful resources

Nothing special besides 'W3School,' 'StackOverflow,' and 'FlexBoxFroggy' to remind me of justify-content: space-align;
